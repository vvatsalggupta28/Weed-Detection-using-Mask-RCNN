# Weed-Detection-using-Mask-RCNN

Object detection is a complicated task for computer vision that requires predicting both 
where the objects are in the picture and what kind of objects have been identified. One 
of the state-of-the-art methods for object recognition tasks is the Mask Region-based 
Convolutional Neural Network, or Mask R-CNN, model.For our own object detection 
tasks, the Matterport Mask R-CNN project provides a library that helps us to build and 
train Mask R-CNN Keras models. While it allows quick training through transfer 
learning with top performing models trained on challenging object detection tasks, such 
as MS COCO, it needs careful preparation of the dataset.
